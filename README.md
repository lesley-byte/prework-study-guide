# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide website.  I am trying to study and learn full stack web development. I want to learn everything.  My ultimate goal is to create a web application to share with the world.  I learned a lot about git and github as well as some ways to increase the webpage's search rating. I'm excited to learn and to get closer to my ultimate goals.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
