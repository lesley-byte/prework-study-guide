# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework study guide website.  I am trying to study and learn full stack web development. I want to learn everything.  My ultimate goal is to create a web application to share with the world.  I learned a lot about git and github as well as some ways to increase the webpage's search rating. I'm excited to learn and to get closer to my ultimate goals.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
